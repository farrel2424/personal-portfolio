## Environment Configuration

This project uses EmailJS to handle the contact form. To make it work, you need to set up your environment variables.

1.  Create a new file in the project root named `.env`.
2.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
3.  Replace the placeholder values (`your_..._here`) with the actual EmailJS API keys.
4.  After creating the `.env` file, you can run the project using `docker-compose up`.

**Note:** The necessary API keys will be provided separately.
